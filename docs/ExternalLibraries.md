# External Libraries

## Bootstrap

It is one of the most used css frameworks of the time, to solve the aesthetics of the site I consider that using bootstrap is the best solution.

You can see more information in [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Firebase 

It was the tool that I learned in the React JS course, it was considered a good opportunity to use. That is why it is included in the project.

You can see more information in [Firebase Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools).

## Formik

It is a tool for creating forms, I found it interesting to be able to integrate a library of this type, in the project you can see the checkout form made with this technology.

You can see more information in [Formik](https://formik.org/)

It also requires installing the library [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass).

## Swiper

It is a library for the creation of sliders, in this way I think it is a good opportunity to implement this library and understand how it works in this new environment.

You can see more information in [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/react/).
